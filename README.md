# MATLAB Drag and Drop
Add drag and drop capabilities to any MATLAB app. 

DRAGNDROP is designed to allow you to easily add drag and drop functionality to your MATLAB-based applications.
To use:
- Unzip dragndrop.zip
- Add the root directory to your path (do not add the @dragndrop directory).
- Run any of the example files in the examples directory (dd_example1.m through dd_example5.m)

These example files function as a basic tutorial on the interface. Additional documentation is available by typing ```doc dragndrop```
